# Cellular Segmentation of Densely Packed Organelles in 3D EM Images of Human Platelets

## Project Overview

This project aims to segment and classify cells and six different types of organelles in 3D electron microscopy (EM) images of human platelets using advanced deep learning techniques. The Mask R-CNN model with Detectron2 is utilized for precise instance segmentation.

## Goals

- Segment cells and six classes of organelles in 3D EM images.
- Achieve high accuracy in identifying and segmenting these structures.
- Provide a robust model for detailed cellular analysis in biomedical research.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Core programming language.
- **Makesense**: Annotation tool for labeling the images.
- **Detectron2**: Library for object detection and segmentation.
- **Mask R-CNN**: Model used for instance segmentation.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for implementing and training models.
